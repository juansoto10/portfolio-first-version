# Portfolio Page

This is my Portfolio Page, the place where I show information about me, my work and skills. You can contact me there, using the contact form or the links to my social media. 

I use JavaScript to handle events and create content dynamically, showing the different projects I have developed.

The layout is made using HTML5 and CSS3 to style and make a responsive design.
